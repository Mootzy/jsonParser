Hello

To use this simply 

1. Copy the absolute path to your directory containing JSON files.
2. nano/vim/code into 'config.py' of this folder
3. paste the path to the directory variable on line 6. 

NOTE: this will overwrite all the json files in the directory and only leave the "abi" section of the files. 
use cautiously.
